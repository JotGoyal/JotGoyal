I'm
Java Developer
The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, I have been working as a Java Developer since last year and also have been lucky to upskill my skills i got chance to learn designing languages. I have skills that include back-end development using Java, and got chance to work with API's, front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript),database (Mysql)
